                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or
                        <br> number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional.
                        <br> It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web.
                        <br> And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.

                    <h2>How does HTML work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" means that,
                        <br> rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses
                        <br> tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to
                        <br> the webpage.
                        <br> Let me show you what I mean. Take a look at the article below. If I were to ask
                        <br> you to label the types of content on the page, you'd probably do pretty well:
                        <br> There's the header at the top, then a subheader below it, the body text, and
                        <br> some images at the bottom followed by a few more bits of text.
                    </p>

                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates
                        <br> how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of
                        <br> the page.

                    <h2>HTML vs CSS</h2>
                    <p>
                        HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. CSS,
                        <br> on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it
                        <br> was intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure
                        <br> websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.
                        <br>
                        <br> If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint.
                        <br> Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your
                        <br> entire website its style. Those slick colors, interesting fonts, and background
                        <br> images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the entire mood and tone of a
                        <br> web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool -- and an important skill for
                        <br> web developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different
                        <br> screen sizes and device types. To show you what CSS does to a website, <br>look at the following two screenshots.
                        <br> The first screenshot is my colleague's blog post, but shown in Basic HTML, and

                        JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't
                        <br> released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all
                        <br> modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more
                        <br> powerful and complex functionality.

                        JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify
                        <br> website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's
                        <br> actions. Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action,
                        <br>and adding new identities to existing information.

                        <br> behaviors.
